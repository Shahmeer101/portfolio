        <h2>Rocks Tell the Earth's Story</h2>
        <h5>The continental crust contains the historical record of our planet. Its most ancient rocks are four billion years old, and the youngest ones are still forming today. Parts of the continental crust may be older than four billion years, but if so, they are not exposed, or have not been found, on the Earth’s surface. The rocks of the crust convey the story of how the planet has been transformed between the period shortly after its formation and the way we see it today.</h5>

        <h2>How Did the Earth Form?</h2>

        <h5>The Sun and its family of planets formed when a cloud of dust and gas condensed 4.6 billion years ago. Several hundred million years after the Earth took form, an outer crust developed. But these surface rocks are no longer available for study: they have disappeared into the interior of our dynamic planet. Our only clues to how the Earth formed come from meteorites and the Moon because both formed simultaneously with the planets.</h5>

        <h2>What Is the Earth Made Of?</h2>
        <h5>The great bulk of our planet is composed of oxygen, iron, silicon, and magnesium. Since the Earth formed relatively close to the Sun by the aggregation of smaller solid bodies, it is a rocky, solid planet whose atmosphere formed later. The more remote, giant gas planets, from Jupiter to Neptune, formed predominantly from the lighter, more volatile elements, like hydrogen and helium.</h5>

        <p>As the Earth started to grow, about 4.56 billion years ago, the heavy iron sank to the center, and the lighter silicates rose to the surface. Heat generated from impacts of other bodies kept the early Earth molten. In fact, the planet’s entire outer layer may have been liquid, an idea that came from studying the Moon. Rocks of the lunar highlands are believed to have solidified from a similar ocean of molten rock, or magma. Unlike the Earth, the Moon is geologically inactive; thus, the cold, solid crust of its magma ocean still exists.

      <p>The oldest-known sedimentary rocks on the Earth comprise the 3.8-billion-year-old Isua Sequence of southwestern Greenland.
The rocks were once sediments formed by chemical precipitation from ocean water.  Intermittent eruptions from nearby volcanoes added other sediment layers.  The Isua rocks tell geologists important things about the early Earth: there already was an ocean in which the sedimentary laters were laid down; volcanoes already existed; and erosion of the rocks was promoted by an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and water vapor.  The rocks also contain geochemical evidence of the earliest life.</p>

      <p>A nearly 3-billion-year-old banded iron formation from Canada shows that the atmosphere and ocean once had no oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms were making oxygen, but it reacted with the iron dissolved in seawater to form iron oxide minerals on the ocean floor, creating banded iron formations.<br>

The dark layers in this boulder are mainly composed of magnetite (Fe3O4) while the red layers are chalcedony, a form of silica (SiO2) that is colored red by tiny iron oxide particles. Some geologists suggest that the layers formed annually with the changing seasons.
This rock records a time from the Earth's distant past, when evolving life profoundly influenced the planet's evolution. The oxygen that is now in the Earth's atmosphere was not there at the beginning.</p>

      <p>The Earth’s crust is its lightest, most buoyant rock layer. Continental crust covers 41percent of the Earth’s surface, though a quarter of that area is under the oceans. The continental crust is 20 to 80 kilometers thick. Its rocks hold four billion years of Earth history. The remainder of the Earth is covered by oceanic crust. This type of crust is young — none older than 170 million years — and is only about 8 kilometers thick.</p>

     <p><span>Heat From the Earth</span>
      The interior of the Earth is hot, and its temperature increases with depth. Some of the heat is left over from Earth’s earliest days, when the planet was partially molten. But most of the heat is generated today by the energy released when unstable, or radioactive, elements transform themselves into stable elements. The most important of these are uranium, thorium, and potassium. These elements are concentrated in the crust, from which much of Earth’s heat now emanates.</p>

      <p><span>Rocks From the Continental Crust</span>
        Continental crust is significantly thicker than oceanic crust. It stands higher and penetrates deeper into the mantle than its oceanic counterpart. The upper continental crust is exposed at many places, and its composition is well known. The lower continental crust is not exposed; geologists learn about it by studying how shock waves from earthquakes and man-made explosions pass through it, and by examining the rare fragments carried to the surface by erupting lavas. </p>

      <p><span>The Oldest Rocks and Minerals on Earth</span>
        Much of the evidence from the oldest period of the Earth’s history, the Hadean era (3.8 to 4.5 billion years ago), has been destroyed by erosion, burial, and modifications of the rocks as they were heated and compressed at depth. Yet clues can be found in the durable mineral zircon. Zircon usually contains a small amount of the radioactive element uranium, and its age can be determined by measuring how much of the uranium has transformed to lead.. </p>
