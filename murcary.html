                       <p> <span>Mercury</span> is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to overlapping impact events. These features are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.

                        According to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has surface temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during sunlight across the equator regions.[19] At Mercury's poles there are large reservoirs of water ices that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which have an estimated mass of about 0.025–0.25% the Antarctic ice sheet.[20] There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimal and rock vaporization.
                        
                        Because Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and 10.61 times the Sun's typical energy received by the Earth: the solar constant. Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the background stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][21] Counterintuitively, due to Mercury's slow rotation, an observer on the planet would see only one Mercurian solar day (176 Earth days) every two Mercurian solar years (88 Earth days each).[4] Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets, about 1⁄30 of a degree, and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System.[b]
                        
                        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit, making it appear in Earth's sky only as a "morning star" or "evening star" that is relatively close to the Sun. In English, it is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce, communication and the messenger of gods. Mercury is the most difficult planet to reach from Earth because it requires the greatest change in a spacecraft's velocity.</p>

              <p>Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid, metallic outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.[29][30] The composition of the iron-rich core remains uncertain, but it likely contains nickel, silicon and perhaps sulfur and carbon, plus trace amounts of other elements.[31] The planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3.[4] If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.[32] Mercury's density can be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.[33]<br>The radius of Mercury's core is estimated to be 2,020 ± 30 km (1,255 ± 19 mi), based on interior models constrained to be consistent with a moment of inertia factor of 0.346±0.014.[9][34] Hence, Mercury's core occupies about 57% of its volume</p>

It is more heterogeneous than the surface of Mars or the Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus.[50] Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity plains.[51] Mercury has "wrinkle-ridges" (dorsa), Moon-like highlands, mountains (montes), plains (planitiae), escarpments (rupes), and valleys (valles).[52][53]<br>

                The planet's mantle is chemically heterogeneous, suggesting the planet went through a magma ocean phase early in its history. Crystallization of minerals and convective overturn resulted in a layered, chemically heterogeneous crust with large-scale variations in chemical composition observed on the surface. The crust is low in iron but high in sulfur, resulting from the stronger early chemically reducing conditions than is found on other terrestrial planets. </p>

The less reflective regions of the crust are high in carbon, most likely in the form of graphite.[54][55]<br>

    Names for features on Mercury come from a variety of sources and are set according to the IAU planetary nomenclature system. Names coming from people are limited to the deceased. Craters are named for artists, musicians, painters, and authors who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field. Ridges, or dorsa, are named for scientists who have contributed to the study of Mercury. Depressions or fossae are named for works of architecture. Montes are named for the word "hot" in a variety of languages. Plains or planitiae are named for Mercury in various languages. Escarpments or rupēs are named for ships of scientific expeditions. Valleys or valles are named for abandoned cities, towns, or settlements of antiquity.[56]

           <p>Mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and asteroids during and shortly following its formation 4.6 billion years ago, as well as during a possibly separate subsequent episode called the Late Heavy Bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago.[57] Mercury received impacts over its entire surface during this period of intense crater formation,[53] facilitated by the lack of any atmosphere to slow impactors down.[58] During this time Mercury was volcanically active; basins were filled by magma, producing smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon.[59][60] One of the most unusual craters is Apollodorus, or "the Spider", which hosts a series of radiating troughs extending outwards from its impact site.[61]

            Craters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped cavities to multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of Mercury's stronger surface gravity.[62] According to International Astronomical Union rules, each new crater must be named after an artist who was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than three years, before the date the crater is named.[63]</p>

            The largest known crater is Caloris Planitia, or Caloris Basin, with a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi).[64] The impact that created the Caloris Basin was so powerful that it caused lava eruptions and left a concentric mountainous ring ~2 km (1.2 mi) tall surrounding the impact crater. The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled by a geologically distinct flat plain, broken up by ridges and fractures in a roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear whether they were volcanic lava flows induced by the impact or a large sheet of impact melt.[62]

            At the antipode of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual, hilly terrain known as the "Weird Terrain". One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around Mercury, converging at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away). The resulting high stresses fractured the surface.[65] Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of ejecta at this basin's antipode.[66]</p>

                    There is evidence for pyroclastic flows on Mercury from low-profile shield volcanoes.[75][76][77] Fifty-one pyroclastic deposits have been identified,[78] where 90% of them are found within impact craters.[78] A study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval.[78]

                    A "rimless depression" inside the southwest rim of the Caloris Basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents, each individually up to 8 km (5.0 mi) in diameter. It is thus a "compound volcano".[79] The vent floors are at least 1 km (0.62 mi) below their brinks and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit.[79] Scientists could not quantify the age of the volcanic complex system but reported that it could be on the order of a billion years.[79]</p>

                        The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 to 700 K (−173 to 427 °C; −280 to 800 °F).[19] It never rises above 180 K at the poles,[14] due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature gradient between the equator and the poles. At perihelion, the equatorial subsolar point is located at latitude 0°W or 180°W, and it climbs to a temperature of about 700 K. During aphelion, this occurs at 90° or 270°W, and reaches only 550 K.[81] On the dark side of the planet, temperatures average 110 K.[14][82] The intensity of sunlight on Mercury's surface ranges between 4.59 and 10.61 times the solar constant (1,370 W·m−2).[83]<br>

                        Although daylight temperatures at the surface of Mercury are generally extremely high, observations strongly suggest that ice (frozen water) exists on Mercury. The floors of deep craters at the poles are never exposed to direct sunlight, and temperatures there remain below 102 K, far lower than the global average.[84] This creates a cold trap where ice can accumulate. Water ice strongly reflects radar, and observations by the 70-meter Goldstone Solar System Radar and the VLA in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar reflection near the poles[80]</p>

                    Despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a significant, and apparently global, magnetic field. According to measurements taken by Mariner 10, it is about 1.1% the strength of Earth's. The magnetic-field strength at Mercury's equator is about 300 nT.[101][102] Like that of Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is dipolar.[96] Unlike Earth's, Mercury's poles are nearly aligned with the planet's spin axis.[103] Measurements from both the Mariner 10 and MESSENGER space probes have indicated that the strength and shape of the magnetic field are stable.[103]

                    It is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a dynamo effect, in a manner similar to the magnetic field of Earth.[104][105] This dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planet's iron-rich liquid core. Particularly strong tidal heating effects caused by the planet's high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep part of the core in the liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect.[106][107]</p>

                    The first telescopic observations of Mercury were made by Thomas Harriot and Galileo from 1610. In 1612, Simon Marius observed the brightness of Mercury varied with the planet's orbital position and concluded it had phases "in the same way as Venus and the Moon".[167] In 1631, Pierre Gassendi made the first telescopic observations of the transit of a planet across the Sun when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by Johannes Kepler. In 1639, Giovanni Zupi used a telescope to discover that the planet had orbital phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited the Sun.[28]

A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of another (occultation), as seen from Earth. Mercury and Venus occult each other every few centuries, and the event of May 28, 1737, is the only one historically observed, having been seen by John Bevis at the Royal Greenwich Observatory.[168] The next occultation of Mercury by Venus will be on December 3, 2133.[169]

                        <p>The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury meant that it was far less studied than the other planets. In 1800, Johann Schröter made observations of surface features, claiming to have observed 20-kilometre-high (12 mi) mountains. Friedrich Bessel used Schröter's drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70°.[170] In the 1880s, Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped the planet more accurately, and suggested that Mercury's rotational period was 88 days, the same as its orbital period due to tidal locking.[171] This phenomenon is known as synchronous rotation. The effort to map the surface of Mercury was continued by Eugenios Antoniadi, who published a book in 1934 that included both maps and his own observations.[96] Many of the planet's surface features, particularly the albedo features, take their names from Antoniadi's map.[172]

                            In June 1962, Soviet scientists at the Institute of Radio-engineering and Electronics of the USSR Academy of Sciences, led by Vladimir Kotelnikov, became the first to bounce a radar signal off Mercury and receive it, starting radar observations of the planet.[173][174][175] Three years later, radar observations by Americans Gordon H. Pettengill and Rolf B.[178]
